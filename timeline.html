                    meeting focused on exploring collaborative efforts to promote energy-efficient cooling solutions and
                    advance sustainable practices in the region, aligning with the UN's development objectives. The
                    visit
                    provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen partnerships between the private sector and
                    international organizations to tackle environmental challenges and enhance energy sustainability.
